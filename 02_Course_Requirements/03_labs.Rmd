Individual lab assignments will feature a series of guided, application-based, statistical analysis prompts that you will complete using IBM\textsuperscript{\textregistered}\ SPSS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}\ Statistics. These assignments require you to apply what you learn within each of the course modules. Each lab assignment will include a detailed set of directions available on the course website. Additionally, you will be provided a skeleton-like lab report template for each of the lab assignments. More details on completing the lab assignments will be provided in class. Table 2 below contains the topic and due date for each lab assignment. *Note*: These are individual assignments. All elements of the academic integrity policy will be upheld.
