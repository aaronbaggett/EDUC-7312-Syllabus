Upon completion of all course modules, you should be able to:

**1. Module 1: Introduction to Data**

  1. Identify variables as numerical and categorical and further classify based its nature.
  2. Define associated variables as variables that show some relationship with one another. Further categorize this relationship as positive or negative association, when possible.
  <!-- 3. Identify the explanatory variable in a pair of variables as the variable suspected of affecting the other. However, note that labeling variables as explanatory and response does not guarantee that the relationship between the two is actually causal, even if there is an association identified between the two variables. -->
  4. When describing the distribution of a numerical variable, mention its shape, center, and spread, as well as any unusual observations.
  5. Identify the shape of a distribution as symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed, and unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, or uniform.

**2. Module 2: Foundations for Statistical Inference**

  1. Identify the direction and strength of both linear and non-linear correlations.
  2. Compute and interpret linear and non-linear correlation coefficients using SPSS.
  3. Summarize visually and verbally the results of linear and non-linear correlation coefficients.

**3. Module 3: Statistical Inference for Numerical and Categorical Data**

  1. Identify occasions when a predictive model is preferred, over others, in educational and social science research.
  2. Compute and interpret the slope, intercept, and response variable(s) in both simple and multiple linear regression models using SPSS.
  3. Summarize visually and verbally the results of both simple and multiple linear regression models.

**4. Module 4: Simple and Multiple Regression**

  1. Identify occasions when either between- and within-groups designs are preferred, over others, in educational and social science research.
  2. Identify statistical assumptions for both one-way and factorial between- and within-groups designs.
  2. Compute and interpret results of main effects, interaction effects, and post-hoc tests in both one-way and factorial between- and within-groups designs using SPSS.
  3. Summarize visually and verbally the results of both one-way and factorial between- and within-groups designs.
